excerpt: 'This paper addresses the challenge of generating physically feasible dynamics in a data-driven context by incorporating physical priors into diffusion-based generative models. While traditional generative approaches often fail to enforce fundamental physical laws, the proposed framework integrates two types of priors: distributional priors, such as roto-translational invariance, and physical feasibility priors, including conservation laws and PDE constraints. By embedding these priors into the generative process, the method efficiently produces realistic physical dynamics, such as trajectories and flows. Empirical evaluations demonstrate its effectiveness across various physical systems, highlighting its potential for advancing AI-driven scientific modeling.'
