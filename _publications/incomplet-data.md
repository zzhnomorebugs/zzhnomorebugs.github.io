excerpt: 'This paper tackles the challenge of learning physical dynamics from incomplete observational data, a fundamental constraint in real-world scientific applications where complete measurements are unavailable. The proposed diffusion-based framework learns directly from partial observations through strategic context-query partitioning that adapts to the underlying observation patterns. Theoretical analysis proves asymptotic convergence to the true complete data distribution, while empirical evaluations on synthetic PDEs and ERA5 climate data demonstrate substantial improvements over baselines, particularly in sparse observation regimes (1-20% coverage). This work provides a principled approach for imputing partially observed dynamics with strong theoretical guarantees and practical applicability.'
