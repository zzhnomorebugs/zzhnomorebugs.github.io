# Education

- Bachelor of Science in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen

# **Research Interests**

- **Solving PDE Dynamics:** Neural differential equations & projection operators & neural operators.
- **Physics-Informed Generation:** Diffusion models with geometric (SE(3)-invariance) and physical priors (PDEs, conservation laws) for 3D structures (molecules, poses) and dynamics.
- **Manifold-Aware Learning:** Projection-free SDE/ODE solvers on SE(3)-invariant manifolds for efficient 3D coordinate generation.

*Applications:* Irregular time-series modeling, molecular conformation, and physics simulations (fluids, climate).
