I am a Ph.D. student in Data Science at [The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen](https://www.cuhk.edu.cn/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Tianshu Yu](https://mypage.cuhk.edu.cn/academics/yutianshu/). My research focuses on **AI4Science**, particularly on developing machine learning methods for solving physical dynamics and generating physically plausible structures.

## Research Interests

My work spans several interconnected areas at the intersection of machine learning and scientific computing:

- **Physics-Informed Machine Learning:** Developing diffusion models and neural operators that incorporate physical priors (PDEs, conservation laws) and geometric invariances (SE(3)-equivariance) for learning and generating physical dynamics.

- **Differential Equation Solving:** Designing neural differential equation solvers and projection operators for forward and inverse problems in partial differential equations.

- **Manifold-Aware Generation:** Developing projection-free SDE/ODE solvers on SE(3)-invariant manifolds for efficient 3D structure generation (molecules, protein conformations).

**Applications:** Molecular conformation generation, protein dynamics simulation, climate modeling, and irregular time-series analysis.

## Recent Highlights

- **NeurIPS 2025:** *TEMPO: Temporal Multi-scale Autoregressive Generation of Protein Conformational Ensembles* (co-author)
- **ICLR 2025:** *Generating physical dynamics under priors* (first author)
- **ICML 2023:** *Learning to decouple complex systems* (first author)
